# TSR_model_comparison

This repository is dedicated to the comparison of models for Table Structure Recognition (TSR). Specifically, it evaluates and contrasts the performance of two advanced models: Table Transformers and Unitable.
Key Features:

    - Models Compared: Table Transformers vs Unitable
    - Evaluation Metric: S-TEDS (Structural Tree Edit Distance Similarity)
    - Dataset Used: SynthTabNet

This comparison is part of my degree project for the title of Masters in Data Science and Analytics from EAFIT University. It aims to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model when applied to the task of recognizing and interpreting table structures from various data sources.
